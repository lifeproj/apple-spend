# apple-spend

Simple script to parse all transactions from my Apple Account into a CSV & generate some useful summary. 
1. You can get all transactions by going to [https://reportaproblem.apple.com](https://reportaproblem.apple.com/)
2. Use [Comet](https://www.perplexity.ai/comet) to doomscroll to the bottom of the page.
3. Save the entire browser page which should download the HTML & other content.

Alternatively, you can also ask Coment to do the CSV generation for you. But when the transaction list grows Comet becomes really slow at it.
In addition it uses external websites such as [https://notepad-online.com/](https://notepad-online.com/) to save the parsed data. 
Since I was not comfortable having it store data on another website even temporarily, Cursor did a good job with the HTML page
